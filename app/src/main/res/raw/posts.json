The problem is we are not all web designers and often mistakes are made \u00a0when building a Church Website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of things to consider in creating a website for a church, for example, having a good layout, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/blog\/taking-perfect-pictures\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">good images<\/a> and videos, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/blog\/typography-for-web-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">good typography<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Your website is the first place someone will look at information about your church and a way to make a good first impression. These are the 14 common mistakes that you should avoid when creating your church website.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Mistake #1 Designing the website for members only<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One of the things to consider in creating a website is who the website is for. Most church websites are all catering to members of their church already and not to someone new who could be a potential member of your church.<\/p>\n<p>For example, this website shows all of their upcoming activities and regular services. While on your website, you want them to be engaged by what they see, show them what your church is about and potentially have them as a guest on your next worship service. One way to ensure this is to have high-quality images.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kcrevolution.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60314\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/members-only.png\" alt=\"web courses bangkok 14 common church website mistakes\" width=\"1920\" height=\"974\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How to fix it<\/h3>\n<p>Consider non-members when creating your website. Have a section or a page designed especially for them like the one shown below.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/gladtidingsomaha.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60334\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/membersonly2.png\" alt=\"web courses bangkok 14 common church website mistakes\" width=\"1606\" height=\"503\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Mistake #2 Not including good images<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When someone visits your website, you want them to be engaged by what they see, show them what your church is about and potentially have them as a guest on your next worship service. One way to ensure this is to have high-quality images.<\/p>\n<p>One example is the website below:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.churchforchrist.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60337\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/no-images.png\" alt=\"web courses bangkok 14 common church website mistakes\" width=\"1920\" height=\"974\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Have images of the services and members actively attending a church activity.<\/p>\n<p>Having images also helps answer one important question when attending a church service, \u201cWhat should I wear?\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3>How to fix it<\/h3>\n<p>An example of a website that has good images is <a href=\"http:\/\/iglesianicristo.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http:\/\/iglesianicristo.net<\/a> They use quality photos to show their church activities and worship services which would make someone visiting their site interested.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/iglesianicristo.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60346\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/no-images2.png\" alt=\"web courses bangkok 14 common church website mistakes\" width=\"1920\" height=\"974\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Mistake #3 No videos of the church worship services<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Videos have the same impact as images do, if not more. Having a clip of the service will help the viewer have a feel of what it\u2019s like to attend a service, what type of music you play in your church, and what they could expect when they attend one of your services.<\/p>\n<p>An example is the website below. There are no videos of their services or activities.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vintagechurch.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60350\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/novideo2.png\" alt=\"web courses bangkok 14 common church website mistakes\" width=\"1920\" height=\"974\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How to fix it<\/h3>\n<p>One website that has videos of their services and other activities is <a href=\"incmedia.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">incmedia.org<\/a>.

You want to show what the church is all about, how it was founded, the doctrines you teach, how it is different from many of the churches around. When a website has bad typography, it could play a big part on the viewer leaving your website right away.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bigfishpresentations.com\/2013\/01\/09\/5-reasons-why-typography-is-powerful\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Typography<\/a> attracts the audience\u2019s attention, it is reader friendly, it establishes an information hierarchy, it helps to create harmony, and it creates and builds recognition.<\/p>\n<p>An example of a church website with bad typography:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dokimos.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60357\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/typographybad.png\" alt=\"web courses bangkok 14 common church website mistakes\" width=\"1475\" height=\"856\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>An example of a church website that has good typography is <a href=\"http:\/\/hillsong.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http:\/\/hillsong.com\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The size and the typeface they use all amount to good readability.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/hillsong.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60361\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/typography2.png\" alt=\"web courses bangkok 14 common church website mistakes\" width=\"1920\" height=\"974\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How to fix it<\/h3>\n<p>Make sure that the text in your website is readable.

They have slow load times and are vulnerable to hackers that is why it is important that you update your website regularly.<br \/>\nThis website\u2019s event page shown below hasn\u2019t been updated since 2016.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.twtlcc.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60483\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/outdated-1.png\" alt=\"web courses bangkok 14 common church website mistakes\" width=\"1465\" height=\"974\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How to fix it<\/h3>\n<p>Updating the website also shows the recent activities of the church and show visitors what the church is about.<br \/>\nOne way to make sure that your website is updated is having a checklist that you can put into a calendar system and have it repeat monthly. We made one that can help you get you started:<\/p>\n<p>\u2610 Have we updated the homepage?<br \/>\n\u2610 Have we added at least one bit of news, event or even a blog post?<br \/>\n\u2610 Have we uploaded the latest pictures into the gallery?<br \/>\n\u2610 Have we uploaded the latest sermon, tv program, or activity?<br \/>\n\u2610 Have we updated the contact info?<\/p>\n<p>This website shows the latest sermon of their church.

This is where a calendar would be very useful. This can also show the person visiting your website that your church is active and could help them make their decision on joining your church.<\/p>\n<h3>How to fix it<\/h3>\n<p>You could show what holidays are coming up using the calendar, what days they can talk to the minister\/pastor\/priest and even show when they can use the church for a wedding. You could also show the upcoming topics that are going to be discussed on the upcoming worship service. There are a lot of benefits of having a calendar on your website so make sure you have one or having an events page would also be good like this:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.umcdiscipleship.org\/worship\/lectionary-calendar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60476\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/calendar.png\" alt=\"web courses bangkok 14 common church website mistakes\" width=\"1017\" height=\"864\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Mistake#8 Buried contact information<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One huge mistake would be not including a way to contact the church and fortunately, most church websites do have a way to contact them although most are not presented or positioned well in the website.<\/p>\n<p>The contact information on the website below is on the footer or the bottom of the page.

The &#8220;parent&#8221; one is <a href=\"http:\/\/akturatech.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"no follow noopener\">Aktura Technology<\/a> and our new focus is <a href=\"https:\/\/contentsnare.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"no follow noopener\">Content Snare.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Screen-Shot-2560-08-10-at-11.13.35.png\" alt=\"Aktura screen shot\" width=\"867\" height=\"460\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Aktura builds web based applications and software for a variety of businesses, but our sweet spot tends to be accountants and start-ups.

This has consistently been a massive pain in the butt for us, so we&#8217;re trying to fix that for us and everyone else in this space.<\/p>\n<h2>2) What is your particular background? How did you get into Web Development<\/h2>\n<p>Right out of university I went into control systems engineering (also called automation). In human-speak, that means making machinery easier to operate or making it operate by itself.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the interface between man and machine. It involves a lot of coding in languages most people aren&#8217;t familiar with &#8211; ladder logic and function block diagrams. In 2008 during the &#8220;Adsense goldrush&#8221;, you could make crappy websites with a few ads, rank them in Google and make a few bucks on the side.<\/p>\n<p>I learned about this and started building sites myself. I spoke about this at my day job and a workmate joined in. We were using a tactic called &#8216;article spinning&#8217; to generate links for SEO. At the time, all the software in that space sucked, big time. We decided we could do it better and started a company not long after. That began a 6-month slog of learning C# mostly from <a href=\"https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"&quot;no noopener\">Stack Overflow<\/a> (haha).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Screen-Shot-2560-08-10-at-11.57.47.png\" alt=\"Stack Flow\" width=\"1243\" height=\"770\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Towards the end of my day job, I was asked to build a couple of web apps. I used that as an excuse to learn ASP MVC for the first, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/course\/web-development-training\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ruby on Rails<\/a> for the second. After a few years of that, we ended up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/course\/wordpress-essentials\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">building WordPress websites<\/a> for local businesses after being asked by a few people who mistakenly thought that&#8217;s what we did.<\/p>\n<h2>3) What courses\/resources\/websites did you use to become a proficient web developer?<\/h2>\n<p>Honestly I think self teaching is one of the best ways. Just by trying to build *something*. You can go through courses and learn some basics &#8211; I still think that is a good idea &#8211; but you learn the hard stuff by going &#8220;I need to do this thing&#8230; but I don&#8217;t know how to make it work&#8230; let&#8217;s find out&#8221;. That means a lot of help from Mr. Google and Stack Overflow, plus trial and error.<\/p>\n<p>That said, I think one of the biggest things is knowing what&#8217;s already available to you in existing frameworks. For example, in my early C# days, I spent a week building a fast lookup system for words in a thesaurus. Then I learned about the &#8220;Dictionary&#8221; class built into .NET which did it 100 times better than I did and required a couple of lines of code.<\/p>\n<p>There are SO many things baked right into frameworks like .NET or Ruby on Rails. Or code that&#8217;s already been written that you can drop in, like the gem system in Rails. It helps to be across those kind of things I think. If you&#8217;re looking for quick starts, I think <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codecademy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"&quot;no noopener\">Code Academy<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/teamtreehouse.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"&quot;no noopener\">Treehouse<\/a> are good places to start. It depends on the language though. I read a massive Ruby book back to back first to understand how the language worked. But then you just have to start trying to make something.<\/p>\n<h2>4) What kind of people do you look for when hiring? What skills \/ personality traits<\/h2>\n<p>This is so hard. We&#8217;ve not yet found a reliable way to know if someone will be good before they start. I don&#8217;t think anyone has.<\/p>\n<p>Having a trial period is a good idea &#8211; a period where you get someone to do a specific feature in a new branch, and see how they build it. See how they work with you. If your gut says no, it&#8217;s probably right and you should get rid of them. My gut feeling has rarely been wrong &#8211; I see that with a lot of other people too.<\/p>\n<p>For <a href=\"http:\/\/www.creativebloq.com\/web-design\/10-qualities-separate-great-web-designers-rest-41514752\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"&quot;no noopener\">specific traits<\/a>, they definitely have to be a problem solver. Someone who will go and find a solution or two before coming back to you with the problem. Someone who&#8217;ll say &#8220;This is the problem. I&#8217;ve found these ways to make it work. This one will take 2 weeks more, but I think in the long term it&#8217;s better because&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>They also have to be good at communicating when something has bogged them down or is causing problems. It&#8217;s so frustrating when someone tells you they&#8217;ve been stuck on something for a few days and haven&#8217;t told you until now.<\/p>\n<h2>5) What are some of the issues that you come up against with your own clients and how to do you solve them?<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s almost always <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elegantthemes.com\/blog\/tips-tricks\/managing-client-chaos-tools-and-techniques-to-help-you-better-manage-client-projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"&quot;no noopener\">expectation management<\/a>. Some clients think that they can give you 2 dot points and you can go away and create some huge app from that.<\/p>\n<p>We need to get better at communicating that their part in this doesn&#8217;t end when they sign the contract &#8211; they&#8217;ll need to commit time to going through feature development and requirements with us. We&#8217;re not mind readers, but I think a lot of clients expect that, without realising that is what they&#8217;re doing.<\/p>\n<p>But regular communication is the resolution to that, at least in most cases. Some clients are lost causes, and you just have to cut those ones. For the others, if you can get them involved in your project management system they can see everything going on, and I think that helps.<\/p>\n<p>We invite our bigger clients into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atlassian.com\/software\/jira\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"&quot;no noopener\">Jira<\/a> where they can provide feedback on issues. Some clients just flat out refuse learning a new system though. The other big issue is not understanding how much custom development costs. If they don&#8217;t have the budget, it&#8217;s probably not a good idea to try to work with them unless there will be some other kind of benefit &#8211; like an amazing case study or flow on work. We&#8217;ve been burned by low budgets way too many times.<\/p>\n<h2>6) We just ourselves registered for <a href=\"https:\/\/contentsnare.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"&quot;no noopener\">https:\/\/contentsnare.com\/<\/a>, can you tell us how it came about<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve just started a video series on this actually. Before custom dev, we built basic WordPress websites as well.<\/p>\n<p>I have an unhealthy obsession with automation, and found that so many parts of the web design process just sucked from that perspective. At first I had this idea to automate the briefing process. I lined up about 15 calls with potential clients (other web designers) through my local network and some online forums, and just asked about their process from getting a lead through to handing the website over at the end.<\/p>\n<p>I tried not to ask leading questions, and just see where the frustrations came through in their voices, and probed further into those parts. Almost all of them ended up hating on the content gathering part of the website build. Real frustration was coming through. That&#8217;s where it all started. Then we build a landing page and started promoting the idea. The reception was epic. Now we&#8217;re just trying to make it work well and make sure it solves the problem for people.<\/p>\n<h2>7) What are the main technologies you used for the frontend and the backend?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/angular.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"&quot;no noopener\">Angular2<\/a> and Rails API.<\/p>\n<h2>8) Why did your selection end up on these technologies?<\/h2>\n<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m no longer the tech guy. It&#8217;s all handled by Mark. But he&#8217;s the kind of guy that is absolutely meticulous in his research. He played around with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/ng2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"&quot;no noopener\">ng2<\/a> for weeks before deciding it was super powerful and that we should use it.<\/p>\n<p>He&#8217;s spoken about the modularity of components a few times which sounds like a big plus. As for Rails API &#8211; we already had the team for that. I don&#8217;t think the back end is as important as it used to be. You can choose just about anything major these days.<\/p>\n<h2>9) Can you tell us a bit about your development cycles, in regards to adding and testing new features\/versions?<\/h2>\n<p>Mark has put a ton of work into this. He&#8217;s created workflows in Jira that automate as much as possible, so that the process must be adhered to. I&#8217;ll do my best to describe how it works, but bear in mind I&#8217;m not to deep into this side any more.<\/p>\n<p>Before Jira, we have a Google Spreadsheet with features prioritised. We pick out the ones that will definitely be developed and put them in Jira, into the backlog. For each cycle, they are moved into to-do and assigned.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-60268\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Screen-Shot-2560-08-11-at-11.19.49.png\" alt=\"JIRA\" width=\"6840\" height=\"2416\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The devs create their new branch and work on the code. There&#8217;s an automated code quality test, then a peer review before it gets rolled into staging. The new features are tested and accepted on staging, and then are rolled into master. We run a similar process with client work as well.<\/p>\n<h2>10) From a technical perspective, did you learn any important lessons, good and bad, that you&#8217;d like to pass on to other upcoming developers?<\/h2>\n<p>I think I covered most of what I&#8217;d say here in the hiring and learning sections. Also, if you&#8217;re the kind of person who worries about if they&#8217;ve picked the wrong technology to work with, probably stop worrying. It&#8217;s just not worth it.<\/p>\n<p>Stick two a major front end framework and a major back end one, provided you like it. Just get really bloody good at those. Every framework has lovers and haters. As long as it works for you, you&#8217;re good.<\/p>\n<p>Oh and do your research when applying for jobs. When someone says something that shows they&#8217;ve researched me or our business, it stands out *so much* in the pile of applications that we get.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1) For those of you who don&#8217;t know you, can you please introduce yourself and your company Hey !

Golf, who is a Senior Graphic Designer and Ira, who is a Graphic Designer Intern, and asked them to share their experience while using these tools.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what they had to say of \u00a0some of the top tools that UI designers are using in 2017 :<\/p>\n<h2>Adobe XD<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-54455 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Screen-Shot-2560-04-12-at-9.53.12-AM.jpg\" alt=\"Adobe XD\" width=\"1714\" height=\"614\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Adobe brand has come to be associated synonymously with design tools over the past few decades, especially when it comes to their offerings of Photoshop and Illustrator.<\/p>\n<p>Adobe XD (also known as Adobe Experience Design CC) offers design and prototype tools, that UI designers can use to build high-fidelity prototypes.<\/p>\n<p>Users rave that the learning curve for this tool is minimal, but one of the often talked about cons is that it&#8217;s not productive when used for building widgets.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this is a slick tool that UI designers can use to effortlessly share prototype with developers, and letting them build according to your specifications.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Official site: <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/sea\/products\/experience-design.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/sea\/products\/experience-design.html<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"quote-left\">\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">&#8220;It\u2019s a really clean application with minimal interface just like Sketch. The tools are simple which are easy to use. I got used to it in a short time as it\u2019s similar to other Adobe programs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">I really love the Repeat Grid feature. It allows you to create content grid such as article list and products list.How you set parameters for the transition between the screen is easy and it allows you to share it online by sending the link to your client.The things I don\u2019t like about XD is you can\u2019t add interactive elements on top of your designs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">For example &#8211; you can\u2019t show and hide the menu by click\/tap on hamburger icon without creating the new screen or you can\u2019t do the light box.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/golfy.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Golf<\/strong>, Experienced UX Designer at WCB Agency<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"quote-right\">\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">&#8220;Adobe XD has the cleanest interface possible and it is probably the easiest design tool to learn as a beginner. They also provide a tutorial in the beginning for the users to get accustomed with the tool, which I found very useful.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">The UI layout is pretty similar to Sketch. Though Adobe XD doesn\u2019t have the Symbols feature, they have the Repeat Grid feature which I think is very impressive. Prototyping in Adobe XD is also very simple.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">The winning point of this tool is to be able to design and prototype on the same platform. It makes the whole UI design process very quick and easy. What I didn\u2019t like was it doesn\u2019t offer a layer control section like most of the other design tools do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/sejuti.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Era<\/strong>, UX\/UI Intern at Web Courses Bangkok<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to get an external review on Adobe XD?

I really like the interface design of this app. You can upload images of multiple file types from Google Drive, Dropbox, or Sketch.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">And also you can change the design in real time by adding link to the plugin. They prepared a design space if you want to build it online too. Once you add the images, you can edit them using simple tools.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">The prototyping and transitions are easily included overlaying interactive element on top of your design as well.While working as a team, you can share and comment things online in real time like a chat system.<\/p>\n<p>This makes it easier to share and add comments so your colleagues can work through.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/golfy.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Golf<\/strong>, Experienced UX Designer at WCB Agency<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"quote-right\">\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">&#8220;Marvel doesn\u2019t need any downloads and there is no installation involved as it is a web based tool.

It made me feel very comfortable to use it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">I loved the presets that they have and was amazed at how they made the designer\u2019s life so easy.

The downside is you have to get used to the program if you have not used it before or have not ever used Adobe. Also, the free version is very limited.\u201c<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/golfy.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Golf<\/strong>, Experienced UX Designer at WCB Agency<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"quote-right\">\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">\u201dJustinmind has got to be the one of the greatest prototyping tools I\u2019ve used. I loved everything about it. It gives you a step-by-step start where you choose the platform or device and basic settings for your prototype.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">The main interface is extremely user-friendly which got a widget section where all kinds of components and layouts are available, an outline section to organize the layers, and a screens section where users get to add new screens and view all the screens.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">It makes it very easy to link the screens and add hotspots. The best part is the widgets section \u2013 consisting of a vast library which covers literally everything you will need to create a sophisticated prototype.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">It might not be as simple to use if you are not familiar with any design tools but they do provide a quick tutorial to help beginners.\u201c<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/sejuti.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Era<\/strong>, UX\/UI Intern at Web Courses Bangkok<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to read an external review on Justinmind? <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prototypingtool.com\/justinmind-wireframe-websites-and-mobile-apps-quickly-and-easily\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See this page.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Axure<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-54462 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Screen-Shot-2560-04-12-at-10.03.39-AM.jpg\" alt=\"axure\" width=\"1040\" height=\"887\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Arguably the most comprehensive prototyping tool mentioned in this list, Axure designers allows UI designers to create clickable wireframes and interactive prototypes.<\/p>\n<p>Adding interactions and ready-made components from the Widget libraries are easy on Axure, and if you are using the Axure RP Pro, then you will have no problems building complex prototypes.<\/p>\n<p>However, those who are working on mobile prototyping will not find Axure a good tool, since it is not mobile user-friendly. On the other hand, if you are working on web and desktop applications, Azure is probably the best rapid prototyping tool you can lay your hands on.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Official site: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.axure.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.axure.com\/<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"quote-left\">\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">\u201dAxure allows free 30 days trial and it\u2019s available for both MacOS and Windows. If you have not used the program before you might be lost since their is no tutorial or guide upon opening.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">You can be quite lost on thinking where to start. It does have an option to share the design online but you will need to create an Axure account.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">Axure has a pen tool that allows you to draw vectors shape to your design but then it converts the shape to png where nowadays modern browser supports svg, Axure has missed out on that.<br \/>\nWith many great prototype tools out there i think i will give Axure a miss.\u201c<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/golfy.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Golf<\/strong>, Experienced UX Designer at WCB Agency<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"quote-right\">\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">\u201dI found Axure very complicated to use as a beginner.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">It has got so many features and terms which are completely unknown to me. It is a powerful tool where you can create nice interactive wireframes but you need some previous experience to be able to do that.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">I felt that the learning curve is very high for Axure comparing to the other tools I have tried. Upon opening up a new file or project, they provide a default folder containing few pages which I thought was unnecessary.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">Overall, I did not like the interface and prefer to have something less complicated.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/sejuti.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Era<\/strong>, UX\/UI Intern at Web Courses Bangkok<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to read an external review on Azure?

What sets Figma apart from the other design tools is &#8211; it offers real-time collaboration with others just as Google Docs, which makes it very easy for designers to collaborate with other designers and the team.<\/p>\n<p>Also, unlike other similar tools like Adobe XD or Sketch, Figma runs completely on the browser and there is no installation involved at all.

You can just drop your sketch design file to Figma and it converts it to a Figma file for you, this is handy if you use Sketch.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">To use Figma templates you do need WebGL on your browser which is a pain to install additional add ons. Figma offers real time collaboration just like google docs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">Currently we have to wait and see how widely Figma is adapted in the community, it does have a lot of element which is like sketch. If you do not want to pay for Sketch I think you can give Figma a try.\u201c<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/golfy.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Golf<\/strong>, Experienced UX Designer at WCB Agency<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"quote-right\">\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">\u201dI found Axure very complicated to use as a beginner.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">\u201dI thought getting started with Figma was very easy. It felt like I was using a web-based version of sketch. The interface is clean where only the necessary tools are present.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">As Figma runs completely on browser, it has got some drawbacks. Some of the functions took really long time to get implemented. The tool even froze completely at a point.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Droid Sans';\">It can be concluded that it is not an effective tool when it comes to dealing with large files as it slow things down.

Your background ?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Hey my name is Marko Islamovic and I\u2019m a founder &amp; CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/gigrove.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">GigRove<\/a>. <\/span><span class=\"s3\">\u263a<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> I\u2019m a generalist \u2013 But I mainly focus on product design &amp; programming. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">For the past few years I\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to help small businesses and independent workers with the help of our software, no matter where they are in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2) Tell us about Gigrove and how did you come up with this idea ?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">I had this idea for a GigRove for a while, so I decided to start building it in 2015. I was 22 when I started building GigRove. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">At that time I\u2019ve noticed how there is a system of global multinational companies, which are able to move around the world and sell products almost wherever they wish, but workers are trapped in one country, they are not able to move freely like companies can, which is then creating a huge disadvantage for startups, small businesses and workers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Basically a hypothesis for GigRove came from this and then me and my team started developing the idea further. As you can probably guess I was a bit socially awkward. 22 and thinking about this things isn\u2019t common.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-56450 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2017-05-19-at-10.26.32-AM.jpg\" alt=\"Gigrove\" width=\"1858\" height=\"921\" \/><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>3) What was the process of creating the website?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Since we were completely in the lean methodology, at first we tried to build only few things that will actually work great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>During accelerated growth, expenses are rising, so we needed to tweak content that we store on our servers and remove a lot of unnecessary features.<\/p>\n<p>That was one of the issues. There were few more.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">We focused only on the essential things that users need \u2013 this was basically creating a directory of hosts, directory of freelancers, messaging system, and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"> It is was challenging because GigRove is basically a talent marketplace, so essentially there are two types of users (hosts and freelancers) who use your product in a different way, so implementing a scaling strategy was hard but essential in the beginning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-56600 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2017-05-22-at-11.45.53-AM.jpg\" alt=\"gigrove 2\" width=\"879\" height=\"676\" \/><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>4) What technologies is it based on and why did you choose them?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">We are running on <a href=\"https:\/\/lemp.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">LEMP stack<\/a> \u2013 mainly because it was the friendliest environment for us. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Each LEMP stack tool has a huge open source community for micro services and this was extremely important factor when deciding on which technology to build GigRove. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">For startups, it\u2019s essential to create fast acceleration and move fast and we saved a lot of time by not trying to build internal tools but use some of the existing open source micro services.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>5) What were some of the challenges you faced from a business perspective? <\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">We asked hard questions for one of our biggest challenges: whether to accelerate fast without profits or to bootstrap our way slowly to a success? \u2013 We decided to go with bootstrapping way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">This is extremely challenging, since we are trying to grow slow but with quality. So we prefer to have few users who actually want to use GigRove frequently instead of having many users who use the product not so frequently.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"learnmore-courses\">\n<div class=\"learnmore-courses-image\"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/hello.jpg\" alt=\"digital marketing students with certificate\" \/><\/div>\n<div class=\"learnmore-courses-content\">\n<div class=\"learnmore-courses-content-inner\">\n<h2>NEW<\/h2>\n<h2>DIGITAL MARKETING BOOTCAMP<\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Learn more about our industry focused course:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/course\/digital-marketing-career\/?utm_source=Internal%20Banner&#038;utm_medium=Banner&#038;utm_campaign=DMPro%202017\" target=\"_blank\">VIEW COURSE<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>6) How do you market Gigrove and what&#8217;s been your most successful channel?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">We try to reach digital nomads and startup communities online, it\u2019s very specific targeting, so we try all the common <a href=\"\/online-marketing-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">online instruments<\/a> to show how GigRove can help them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>7)<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>How do you see the future for Gigrove ?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">GigRove was a fun project for me in the beginnings but it turned out that a lot of people find it useful. Hopefully more people will see what we\u2019re trying to achieve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">We want to try to influence the future of work and regulations \u2013 to be radically different on how companies and workers collaborate globally. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">This requires educating governments, citizens and companies that\u2019s in their best interest to accept and support what we\u2019re trying to do. And that\u2019s hard! So a lot of the future depends on how we are able to influence those things.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">At the moment, concept of GigRove is just a base for our slogan \u201cWork Anywhere\u201d. There will be some exciting changes in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-56605 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2017-05-22-at-12.09.29-PM-1.jpg\" alt=\"gigrove 3\" width=\"1400\" height=\"645\" \/><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>8) What Skills do you feel are today higher in demand from business perspective ? <\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Definitely skills related to IT.

Simply find a user and send a collaboration request. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">It\u2019s pretty slick so we encourage your users to check it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>10) What advice would you give to our students ?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">I think that it\u2019s great time to study IT. What\u2019s great about IT is that you can create opportunities for yourself and not wait for others to offer you one. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Learning is better when you try to teach someone else, so help fellow students out \u2013 it\u2019s in your interest to help them out because it will make you think more about the problem and then you will acquire new knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">If some of you, will want to build something cool that people will use, it\u2019s not clear to understand what to create. A lot of times I get the question: \u201cWhat should I build?\u201d. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">My advice is this: Build the things that matter to YOU. Solve problems that matter to YOU. There must be some people that have a problem like you do. Knowing this will hopefully give you confidence to create something you love.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1) Tell us something about yourself Marko ?

We&#8217;re going to make it easy for you to figure out which one will be best for your business. \u00a0Typically, when a business runs an FB ad, they\u00a0are looking for one of two things: brand awareness and\/or conversions.<\/p>\n<h4>Awareness<\/h4>\n<p>Objectives that generate interest in your product or service:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boost your posts<\/li>\n<li>Promote your page<\/li>\n<li>Reach people near your business<\/li>\n<li>Increase Brand Awareness<\/li>\n<li>Increase your reach<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Conversions<\/h4>\n<p>Objectives that get\u00a0people interested in your business, either to make a purchase, or use your product or service:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase conversions on your website<\/li>\n<li>Increase engagement in your app<\/li>\n<li>Get people to claim your offer<\/li>\n<li>Promote a product or catalogue<\/li>\n<li>Get people to visit your shops<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Step #3 Choosing Your Audience<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-54304 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Facebook-ads-3.png\" alt=\"facebook ads\" width=\"900\" height=\"544\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This has to be the most important step in creating a successful campaign. I can&#8217;t stress enough on the importance of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.treefrogmarketing.com\/understanding-target-audience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">knowing your audience.<\/a>\u00a0Overlooking this\u00a0is\u00a0the #1 reason why businesses fail.<\/p>\n<p>Since Facebook knows everything about us, the more you know about your audience, the better your chances are of getting that\u00a0ad in front of the right group of people\u00a0who wants your services.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Location, starting with a country, state, city, zip code, or address, and refining even further with a mile radius<\/li>\n<li>Age<\/li>\n<li>Gender<\/li>\n<li>Languages<\/li>\n<li>Interests\u00a0\u2013 Facebook looks at a person\u2019s interests, activity, the Pages they like, and closely related topics<\/li>\n<li>Behaviors\u00a0\u2013 Things like purchase behavior and intent, as well as device\u00a0usage<\/li>\n<li>Connections\u00a0\u2013 Choose to show the ad to all people, just those connected to Buffer, or those not connected to Buffer<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let&#8217;s use one of my favorite Italian restaurant in Ekkamai, called La Tana. The marketing goal for\u00a0this restaurant was\u00a0to increase patronage during lunchtime (between 11-2pm).\u00a0FB ads are perfect for restaurants. Because, let&#8217;s face it, everyone on Facebook likes to eat. When targeting your audience, you want to focus on your ideal or current customer(s).<\/p>\n<p>La Tana current clients consist of men and women ages 30-45. It is\u00a0one of the more pricier restaurants in the area. The average customer spends on average 750-1,000 baht when dining at La Tana.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-54119 \" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Screen-Shot-2560-04-10-at-10.06.26-AM.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"711\" height=\"456\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When trying to drive lunchtime traffic, it would be wise to target corporate offices(the corporate demographic typically has the money to spend, and also falls within our customer age range of 30-45) in the area using the zip code option.<\/p>\n<p>This is more targeted than the city option because you can geo-target certain neighbourhood\/areas that house your ideal customer.\u00a0Seeing that we are advertising for the lunch crowd, proximity plays a huge role. As we know, the average employee has a one-hour lunch break.<\/p>\n<p>I would target companies within a 1-3 mile radius (they can get to the restaurant pretty quickly) and have the\u00a0ad run from 9-1pm. This timeframe is usually when the tummy starts to rumble and is ready for lunch.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Step #4 Set Your Budget<\/h3>\n<p>Now, we have our target audience. It\u2019s time to decide how much we will <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jonloomer.com\/2014\/07\/08\/facebook-ads-budget-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">spend marketing<\/a> to them, and for how long.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-54120 \" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Screen-Shot-2560-04-10-at-10.07.17-AM.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"953\" height=\"363\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily:\u00a0A daily budget is the average that you\u2019ll spend every day.<\/li>\n<li>Lifetime:\u00a0A lifetime budget is the maximum that you\u2019ll spend during the lifetime of your advert set.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">How Much Should I Spend on an Ad?<\/h4>\n<p>This is a very good question. From\u00a0my experience, it doesn&#8217;t matter what industry you are in, or how much\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.bufferapp.com\/facebook-advertising-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">marketing budget<\/a>\u00a0you have. I would always suggest that if it&#8217;s the first time running the\u00a0ad &#8211; Budget $5-10 a day(estimated average daily reach of 540-2,700 people) and run the ad for 7 days. This will give you feedback on how the ad is converting, and how it&#8217;s resonating with your audience.<\/p>\n<p>$5-10 dollar a day is a feasible budget for most small or local business such a La Tana to get their feet wet in FB advertising. After you have gotten the right converting ad formula down, feel free to increase your budget an extra $5-10 dollars a day.\u00a0Of course, the higher the budget, the greater your reach. I recently worked on a Facebook ad project for a supplement company. Their budget was \u00a0a whopping $100 per day(estimated daily reach of 8,000-21,000 people).<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this was a 6 figure company, that\u00a0had the money to grow their product and presence online. If you are a smaller business, don&#8217;t let this deter you from advertising via Facebook. A small investment can yield big returns.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Step #5 Create Your Ad<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-54306 \" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/facebook-ad-format.png\" alt=\"facebook ads format\" width=\"1393\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Facebook currently offers 5 formats for adverts<\/strong>:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Carousel:\u00a0Create an advert with 2 or more scrollable images or videos<\/li>\n<li>Single image:\u00a0Create up to 6 variations of your advert using 1 image<\/li>\n<li>Single video:\u00a0Create an advert with one video<\/li>\n<li>Slideshow:\u00a0Create a looping video advert with up to 10 images<\/li>\n<li>Canvas:\u00a0Tell a more immersive story by combining images and videos<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i>Don\u2019t forget to size your image(s) and video(s) correctly. <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/ads-guide\/clicks-to-website\/links?toggle0=Photo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><i>FB ad image specs<\/i><\/a><i> are 1200X 628 pixels and image ratio 1.91:1.

The goal is to see which image, video, audience, font, color, ad copy, etc gets you the highest click through rate(CTR) or call to action(CTA).\u00a0I typically perform A\/B testing on two images at a time. Running too many variations\u00a0can interfere with results. After running these ads simultaneously for 5 days, we learned that Ad B had 55 clicks to the website, while Ad A had only 5.<\/p>\n<h4><strong> Why\u00a0the difference?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The target audience (Women 25-40) identified with Ad B, which is the one that focuses on the woman&#8217;s face, and not Ad A, which showed the trainers face. Without A\/B testing, a lot of time and money could have been wasted trying to find that image that resonated with the gym&#8217;s target audience.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Boost Sales With Retargeting<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Have you looked at a product on let&#8217;s say, AMAZON?

I also really like the CTA CLICK HERE tab.<\/p>\n<p>Retargeting can help your business and\/or product stay relevant while customers may be looking for other options. It&#8217;s a great way to give your audience a second, third or even fourth chance to purchase your product. Running Facebook ads can help with the social growth of your business. If you want to be successful at Facebook advertising campaigns, I would suggest starting small.

Magnets &#8211; The Perfect Landing Page"},"content":{"rendered":"<h2>What<strong> Is a Lead Magnet?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>The first question is obvious: what exactly is a lead magnet?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In online marketing terms, a lead magnet is a free offer you make to customers in order to encourage engagement. In most cases, brands will offer this incentive in exchange for a visitor\u2019s email address. For instance, a digital marketing firm might offer a free e-book giving a crash course in SEO tactics. All that the customer has to do to get a copy of the e-book, is to simply provide a valid email address. In this case, the e-book is the lead magnet; it\u2019s an incentive that customers want, and are willing to join an email list to get.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is an example of a lead magnet:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55993 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-2.13.02-PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"583\" height=\"139\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>The second question is benefits: what advantages can your business get by employing a lead magnet strategy?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After all, isn\u2019t a lead magnet essentially just a bribe to get visitor contact information? And wouldn\u2019t you be better off trying to sell a product upfront, rather than getting an email address and spamming your leads later?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The truth is that the average customer won\u2019t make a purchase upon his or her first-ever website visit. Instead, customers prefer to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crazyegg.com\/blog\/reasons-people-buy-products-online\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">browse your site, find out about your products and services, look at what your competitors are offering<\/a>, read up on your brand, and consider the pros and cons of buying with you. If you are only pitching product sales on your website, you risk missing out on all of these more hesitant buyers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By using lead magnets, you can accomplish two things. First of all, you get qualified leads to join your email list willingly. You can use this information to pitch product sales later or to provide your prospective customers with information they might find useful. Secondly, you give your visitors a complimentary incentive that is inherently linked to your brand. In other words, you start laying the groundwork for a positive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.outboundengine.com\/blog\/7-benefits-of-content-marketing-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">brand-customer relationship<\/a>, which can drive profitable interactions later.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Building Great Landing Pages with Lead Magnets<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the important things to understand about lead magnets is how many different variations they can take. The \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.sendlane.com\/power-attract-9-lead-magnets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">incentive<\/a>\u201d you offer as a lead magnet can be an e-book, as discussed above, but it can also be a free software trial, an email course, a webinar, a helpful checklist, an infographic, a video tutorial, a free consultation, or a free product sample. Truly, you can get as creative as you want with your lead magnet.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many of the most successful landing pages on the web are the ones that put a lead magnet front and center. Typically, these landing pages will include three key elements: a button or link the visitor can click to access the lead magnet, a call to action, and a bit of information about what they will get out of the lead magnet.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consider this <a href=\"https:\/\/offers.hubspot.com\/essential-guide-internet-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HubSpot page<\/a>, where the company encourages visitors to download a free e-book about internet marketing.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55936 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-10.00.40-AM.jpg\" alt=\"hubspot\" width=\"1044\" height=\"86\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55909 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-9.24.40-AM.jpg\" alt=\"Lead magnets\" width=\"1204\" height=\"855\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55917 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-9.32.28-AM.jpg\" alt=\"lead magnets\" width=\"890\" height=\"451\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55987 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-1.52.09-PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"817\" height=\"680\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55920 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-9.33.44-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1003\" height=\"702\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All of the details discussed above are there. The call to action is \u201cLearn the building blocks for successful online marketing.\u201d There is a \u201cContinue\u201d \u00a0button that users can follow to provide their personal details and download the e-book. And there is a bit of information about what visitors will gain from downloading and reading the book\u2014including sample pages from the e-book and a bullet point list of the key topics covered.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since this particular lead magnet is not hosted on the HubSpot homepage, there is also a brief description at the top of the page that explains what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HubSpot<\/a> actually does as a company. Other times, the lead magnet will be baked right into the home page.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.spotify.com\/us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Consider the Spotify landing page<\/a>; set against a colorful, eye-catching background, the above-the- fold part of the page is just the words \u201cMusic for everyone.\u201d with two buttons provided underneath.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55923 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-9.41.32-AM.jpg\" alt=\"spotify lead magnets\" width=\"1373\" height=\"680\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first button (\u201cGet Spotify Free\u201d) is both the lead magnet and the call to action. If you click it, you will be directed to a page where you can either provide your email address to set up an account or create an account through your Facebook username.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you scroll down the Spotify homepage, you will find more information about the\u00a0service it\u00a0offers, as well as another lead magnet link.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55924 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-9.42.30-AM.jpg\" alt=\"spotify lead magnet\" width=\"1334\" height=\"848\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This strategy is another element of successful landing pages: they provide lead magnet and call to action links at both the top and bottom of the page, to maximize the number of engagements.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Landing pages and home pages are just two of the places you might position your lead magnets. You might promote them in blog posts, at the bottom (or even in the middle) of the content. Email newsletters, social media blasts, or even cover photos on your brand\u2019s social profiles can also be effective spots to put a lead magnet.<\/p>\n<div class=\"learnmore-courses\">\n<div class=\"learnmore-courses-image\"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/hello.jpg\" alt=\"digital marketing students with certificate\" \/><\/div>\n<div class=\"learnmore-courses-content\">\n<div class=\"learnmore-courses-content-inner\">\n<h2>NEW<\/h2>\n<h2>DIGITAL MARKETING BOOTCAMP<\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Learn more about our industry focused course:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/course\/digital-marketing-career\/?utm_source=Internal%20Banner&#038;utm_medium=Banner&#038;utm_campaign=DMPro%202017\" target=\"_blank\">VIEW COURSE<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<h2><strong>Tools to Get Started<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are trying to build better landing pages and get more traction out of your lead magnets, you\u2019ll need the right tools to get started.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.leadpages.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><strong>LeadPages<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55938 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-10.03.17-AM.jpg\" alt=\"lead pages\" width=\"1229\" height=\"720\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/unbounce.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Unbounce.com<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55939 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-10.03.47-AM.jpg\" alt=\"unbounce\" width=\"1193\" height=\"693\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are partial to LeadPages and Unbounce.com, both of which offer templates, drag-and- drop functionality, A\/B testing, and other tools you will need to build and optimize your landing pages.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The importance of Content in Lead Magnets<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cio.com\/article\/3185406\/marketing\/7-reasons-why-content-is-still-king-in-2017.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Content is King<\/a>\u201d has long been one of the most popular mottos in the world of marketing, but what does this mantra actually mean\u2014particularly in the world of modern marketing? Specifically, how can your business use content marketing to grow and reach customers more effectively? Read on to learn more about what content marketing means for your brand.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What Is Content Marketing?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/what-is-content-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Content marketing is simply defined<\/a>. When your business implements a content marketing strategy, the first part of what you are trying to do is create relevant, interesting, original, and high-quality content. The second part involves distributing and promoting that content, so that it reaches your target audience and converts readers into paying customers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reason that many people get confused about content marketing is that the word \u201ccontent\u201d itself can mean so many different things. A blog post on your website is content. A video that you share on one of your social profiles is content. An outreach post on another website or blog is content. Even a television commercial can qualify as content\u2014though it is also advertising.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is an example of content marketing, in the form of blog posts, on Web Courses Bangkok&#8217;s <a href=\"\/category\/blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"internal noopener noreferrer\">website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55963 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-11.01.16-AM.jpg\" alt=\"wcb\" width=\"1166\" height=\"772\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The goal with content marketing is to take all of these different types and definitions of content and blend them into a campaign that is bringing value to your target audience across the board.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Content marketing is creating rich, informative blogs and articles that people want to read, discuss, and share with their friends. Content marketing is generating fun videos with the potential to go viral. Content marketing might even mean building a TV spot that is so innovative, engaging, inspiring, or visually compelling that customers not only watch it when it comes up on their TV screens but also go looking for it online.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With content marketing, you can promote your brand in a positive fashion without coming across as overly promotional. With so much advertising at every turn, consumers want brand promotion to be less one-sided. Most adverts just bombard customers with information about brand product and services, trying to encourage a purchase.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the customer could potentially benefit from those products and services, he or she isn\u2019t benefitting from the advertisement directly. With content marketing, consumers are getting something from the brand that they consider valuable\u2014be it a blog, a podcast, or a video guide. In turn, they have more positive brand associations, and are more likely to become paying customers of that brand in the future.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Examples of Great Content Marketing<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because consumers want less overt advertising and more mutually beneficial promotion, content marketing has become wildly popular over the past few years. That growth has made strategies like SEO and social media marketing more competitive, because every brand is trying to make its content more visible. Luckily, it has also brought a wealth of high-quality content for consumers to engage with and enjoy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indeed, if you are looking for inspiration for your company\u2019s content marketing strategy, all you really have to do is start browsing the web. Whether you look at the world\u2019s biggest brands, or your closest market competitors, you are bound to find engaging, innovative content.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Need a great example? Consider Farmers Insurance, which curates a content page on its website called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.farmers.com\/inner-circle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Farmers Inner Circle<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55945 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-10.34.12-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1173\" height=\"851\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Inner Circle is a complete content hub, where Farmers frequently posts articles, blogs, and tutorials that provide helpful insight and tips about insurance, finance, protecting your investments, and more. Lots of brands will start their content strategy with a blog. Not many are as innovative as the Farmers Inner Circle hub, which goes beyond insurance to cover a vast variety of topics about life\u2019s many twists and turns.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another brand that is doing great work in the realm of content marketing is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vinylmeplease.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Vinyl Me, Please<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55947 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-10.36.54-AM.jpg\" alt=\"vinyl me please\" width=\"1753\" height=\"798\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A popular record collector\u2019s club, the company is built around a monthly subscription service where members receive one limited-run, collectible of vinyl each month. However, Vinyl Me, Please also runs its own online music magazine, providing album reviews, \u201calbum of the week\u201d columns, list based features, interviews, podcasts, and more. The pieces are detailed and long-form, providing readers with plentiful content about the joys of record collecting and the pleasures of listening to music in general. In other words, the content is there to promote and glorify the record collecting hobby\u2014with the goal of encouraging readers to buy a Vinyl Me, Please subscription.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Finding Ideas for Your Content Marketing Strategy<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These are just two examples in the big, big sea of content marketing. You may be able to use their ideas and tactics to help you plan your own content marketing strategy. If you feel like neither brand is particularly similar or relevant to yours, don\u2019t worry. There are plenty of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.curata.com\/blog\/content-marketing-tools-ultimate-list\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tools<\/a> out there to help you get ideas for great content. You might just start with Google, looking up brands in your industry, and seeing what types of content tend to rank highly in your searches. Alternatively, you can try BuzzSumo, a tool that lets you search specific keywords or topics, and find out which pieces of content have performed best in terms of social shares.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/buzzsumo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">BuzzSumo<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55968 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.webcoursesbangkok.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2560-05-08-at-11.06.22-AM.jpg\" alt=\"buzzsumo\" width=\"1362\" height=\"805\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can also use BuzzSumo to look up specific competitors and see which content pages of theirs are performing best.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t Forget the Title!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The last thing you need to remember about content marketing is how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jaysondemers\/2016\/11\/30\/how-headline-best-practices-will-change-in-2017\/#ce36c0c22082\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">important<\/a> titles or headlines are. You can have an awesome video or a detailed, well-researched blog, but if you don\u2019t have a great title, you are handicapping your content. A great title should be short, sweet, accurate, keyword-optimized, and engaging. You need people to see the value in your title right away\u2014whether they see it on your site, on social media, or in a Google search. If you can manage a great title, you\u2019ll get more clicks and see better results from your content marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Author:<br \/>\nTim<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/betterasktim.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">betterasktim.com<\/a> &#8211; Digital Marketing Phuket<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What Is a Lead Magnet?
